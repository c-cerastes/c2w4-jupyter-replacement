# My Repository on GitHub.

**Austin Joseph**

This is a substitution for IBM Watson Cloud's Jupyter Notebook for the course 2, week 4 peer graded assignment. Used to work for the government, but now learning programming and data science for a more tech oriented career.

_Labs I used to volunteer in for my neuroscience degree often used data science work, and I'd like to return to that field and/or apply my knowledge of that field._

### The code in the text_conversion.py file of the repo is meant to take an input string and convert the string to alternating caps.
